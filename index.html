<h2>About Me</h2>
<p align="justify">
I am a PhD candidate at The Ohio State University under the guidance of
<a href="https://kevinliu-osu.github.io/">Prof. Jia (Kevin) Liu</a>.
I am very passionate about research in the field of Deep Learning, particularly
efficient Distributed Deep Learning, from theoretical first principles to its
applications in Natural Language Processing and Image Processing.
My current research interests are in the broad areas of Federated Learning,
Continual Learning and Multi-objective Prompt Optimization.
In the initial years of my MS/PhD at OSU, I worked with <a
href="https://ece.osu.edu/people/schniter.1">Prof. Philip Schniter</a> in 
Deep Regularization methods for Image Processing, Approximate Message
Passing algorithms for image inverse applications.
Prior to doing my PhD, I worked at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc)
Bangalore, with
<a href="https://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/simmhan/">Prof. Yogesh Simmhan</a>,
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37409940600">Dr. Malati Hegde</a>,
and <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085441271">Mr. SVR Anand</a>.
There, I worked on development and real-world deployment of wireless sensor
networks for air pollution monitoring under the SATVAM project.
In my spare time, I love playing racquet sports, hiking, singing, playing the
guitar, and reading books.
