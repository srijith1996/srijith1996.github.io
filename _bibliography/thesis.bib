    abstract={Image denoising is a fundamental problem in image processing where a high fidelity image is recovered from a noise corrupted version.   Denoising is fundamental because, from the Bayesian perspective  denoisers are believed to also encode information about the prior  probability distribution of images. This in turn, makes denoisers a  widely applicable tool in many image inverse problems like  compressive sensing, deblurring, in-painting, super-resolution, etc.  As a result various algorithmic approaches for denoising have  been studied in the past decades. However, data-driven denoising  methods, which learn to denoise images from large image datasets  using deep neural networks, have demonstrated far superior  performance compared to the classical algorithmic methods while  having much faster inference times. The data-driven methods can be  broadly classified into two categories: blind and non-blind methods.  While non-blind methods require knowledge of the noise level  contained within the image, blind methods which require no  such information are more practical.  However, the performance of  many recent state-of-the-art blind denoisers depend heavily on the  noise levels used during training.  In more recent work, ideas of  inducing scale and normalization equivariance properties in  denoisers have been explored in order to make denoisers more robust  to changes in noise levels from training to test data. In our work  we extend upon this idea, where we introduce a method to make  any given denoiser normalization equivariant using a simple idea of  instance normalization, which improves the noise level robustness of  the denoiser by a significantly large margin with minimal change to  the underlying architecture. In this thesis, we theoretically  formulate our idea from the perspective of minimizers of the  Wasserstein-1 distance  between empirical distributions of training  and test data, and propose a more practically feasible  2-pixel approximation that yields a quantile-based instance  normalization method which makes our proposed normalization more  robust to outlier pixels in images.  Our instance normalization  method can be implemented as a straightforward extension of any  denoising architecture, thus leveraging the inherent qualities of  the underlying denoiser, without compromising on robustness and  qualitative performance. },
